Objective: LED turns on by press of a button, turns off otherwise.

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(9, INPUT_PULLUP);

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  int state = digitalRead(9);
  //digitalWrite(13, LOW); these were comments for testing, I got confused with the concept as first it would do the opposite
    //delay(10000); testing with delays
    if(state == HIGH) {
      //digitalWrite(13, LOW);
      digitalWrite(13,LOW);
    }
    else {
      //digitalWrite(13,HIGH); ^
      digitalWrite(13,HIGH);
    }
    //delay(1000);
